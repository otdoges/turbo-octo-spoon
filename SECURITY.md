# Security Practices

This document outlines security practices and improvements made to the codebase.

## Recent Security Fixes

### 1. XSS Protection for AI-Generated Content

**Date:** Current Date
**Issue:** The use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with AI-generated content in `ImageAnalysisPanel.tsx` and `ContentEnhancementPanel.tsx` introduced a potential XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability where malicious scripts could be injected via the AI's output.

**Fix:** Implemented DOMPurify to sanitize HTML content before rendering:
- Added DOMPurify library to sanitize HTML
- Configured allowlists for HTML tags and attributes
- Applied sanitization to all AI-generated content before passing to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`

**Code Example:**
```typescript
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

const formatContent = (text: string) => {
  // First format the text with HTML
  const formatted = text
    .replace(/(\d+\.\s+[A-Z\s]+:)/g, '<h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-4 mb-2 text-indigo-700">$1</h3>')
    // Other formatting...
    .join('');
    
  // Sanitize the HTML to prevent XSS attacks
  return DOMPurify.sanitize(formatted, {
    USE_PROFILES: { html: true },
    ALLOWED_TAGS: [
      'h3', 'strong', 'li', 'p', 'ul', 'ol', 'em', 'b', 'i', 'span'
    ],
    ALLOWED_ATTR: ['class', 'style']
  });
};
```

## Continuous Security Practices

### Pre-Deployment Security Checks

We run automated security checks before deployment to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive information:

1. **API Key Detection:** The `security-check.js` script scans the codebase for potential API keys, tokens, or other sensitive information.

2. **Environment Variables:** All sensitive configuration is stored in environment variables through `.env` files (which are gitignored).

3. **Type Safety:** TypeScript is used throughout the codebase to provide type safety and prevent common security issues.

### Best Practices

1. **HTML Sanitization:** Always sanitize any HTML content before rendering it with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

2. **API Key Management:** Never hardcode API keys. Always use environment variables.

3. **Input Validation:** Validate all user inputs before processing.

4. **Content Security Policy:** Implement CSP headers to reduce XSS risks.

5. **Regular Dependency Updates:** Keep dependencies updated to avoid known vulnerabilities.

6. **Code Reviews:** Conduct security-focused code reviews for changes involving user data handling, authentication, or third-party API integrations.
